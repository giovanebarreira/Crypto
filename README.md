Key improvements:

flex-wrap: wrap;: This crucial addition allows the images to wrap onto the next line when the screen is too narrow to fit all three side-by-side. This creates the 3x3 grid you're looking for, adapting to different screen sizes.
margin: 0.5%;: This provides a consistent margin around all sides of each image, making the layout cleaner and more balanced.

Explanation:

The display: flex and flex-wrap: wrap combination creates a responsive grid layout.
width="32%" sets each image's width to approximately one-third of the container, allowing three images per row on larger screens.
margin: 0.5% adds a small margin around each image for spacing.
Replace "screenshots/screenshot1.png", etc., with the actual paths to your screenshot images. Make sure the screenshots folder (or wherever your images are) is in the correct place relative to your README file.

This improved code will display your screenshots in a 3x3 grid on larger screens and gracefully wrap them onto multiple rows on smaller screens, ensuring a good viewing experience on any device. Remember to replace the placeholder image paths with your actual file paths.
